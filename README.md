# String-Encryption-Decryption
This assembly program decodes/ecodes a series of strings using different encrypting/decrypting methods such as XOR on two strings of bytes,rolling XOR on a string of bytes, XOR between two strings represented by hexadecimal characters, Decrypting a string in a base32 representation, Bruteforce XOR with a 1 byte key. (clue: decrypted string contains "force" string), Vigenere Cipher.
